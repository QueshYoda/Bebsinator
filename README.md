## LED Clock & Remote Control System

This is an Arduino-based project that integrates a **TM1637 4-digit display**, an **IR remote control**, and **LED control**. The project allows users to:

- Display time on a TM1637 display.
- Control LED modes using an IR remote.
- Adjust time and brightness using remote buttons.
- Implement various LED blinking patterns.

## Components Used

- **Arduino Board**
- **TM1637 4-Digit Display**
- **IR Receiver Module**
- **Infrared Remote**
- **3mm Red LEDs**
- **10x10 Perforated Plate**
- **Wires**
- **IKEA RÃ–DALM**

## Features

- Display and update the time.
- Adjust time using remote buttons.
- Control LED states and blinking patterns.
- Adjust display brightness.
